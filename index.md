I am a junior at MIT (class of 2024) studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Learning Machines and Physical Systems. I'm also minoring in math. Currently an undergrad researcher (UROP) under Pulkit Agrawal with the [Improbable AI Group](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) and under Daniela Rus with the [Distributed Robotics Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory) at MIT CSAIL.

**I believe that robotics is a constant interaction between the body (mechanisms, design) and the mind (control schemes, planners, deep learning). I'm most interested in mechanics and software co-design: how do we let these two things inform each other?**

### engineering interests
- robust autonomy
- robotic manipulation and motion planning
- loss of function robotics
- mechanical design
- deep learning
- space systems applications
- emergency response applications

### other passions
- education accessibility
- housing and healthcare equity
- queer studies ([see my current reading list](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/list/share/1900259209_alinasarmiento/1900265989_queer_literature))

more about me ~ I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts but I come from Newark, California in the SF Bay Area. My pronouns are they/all. I am a serial sock mismatcher.
