# Alina Sarmiento
## hello hello
I am a second year undergraduate student at MIT. My major is Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Learning Machines and Physical Systems, and I'm minoring in astronomy. Engineering wise, I'm interested in robust autonomous robotics, deep learning, and space systems. I also have interests in education, housing and healthcare equity, diversity and inclusion, and queer studies.
