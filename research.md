### ‘Blackfishing’ harms Black community, highlights societal double standards
    
I'm working with Lilly Chin to create computational design tools and pipelines for fluidic and tactile sensor prototyping. We're focusing on adding sensor capability to her work on handed shearing auxetics (HSAs), as well as iterating on the team's tactile sensors for soft robotic grasping.

Using: Grasshopper, Rhino, Rhinoscript, Carbon3D printer, basic electronics

### Venous Materials ~ _Tangible Media Group (MIT Media Lab)_
    
I worked with postdoctoral student Hila Mor and faculty advisor Hiroshi Ishii to help develop a more user intuitive interface for Venous Materials: physical fluidic circuits and veins as pressure and deformation sensors. Prototyped a method to print the designs using a novel type of nonplanar 3D printing, as well as streamlining the user interface of the design tool and prototyping different types of logic gate primitives.

Used: Grasshopper3D, Rhino
