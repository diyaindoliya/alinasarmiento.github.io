I like to dabble in lots of different art mediums, from paint to poetry to puppets! Some of my casual work can be seen on my art instagram [@indoorelephant](https://instagram.com/indoorelephant)

### Carried - art/poetry zine

![thumbnail for Carried zine](/assets/carried_thumbnail_small.jpg)

Recently, I also made a zine! Inspired by the experiences of my family and others in my community, _Carried_ is a short collection of four illustrated poems about immigration, inter-generational trauma, and Asian American identity. Carried specifically explores the mother-child bond, what it means to leave a place, and the things that we carry with us.
