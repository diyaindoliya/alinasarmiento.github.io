# about me

I am a junior at MIT (class of 2024) studying Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Learning Machines and Physical Systems. I'm also minoring in math. [^1] Currently an undergrad researcher (UROP) under Pulkit Agrawal with the [Improbable AI Group](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/) and under Daniela Rus with the [Distributed Robotics Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory) at MIT CSAIL.

I believe that robotics is a constant interaction between the body (mechanisms, design) and the mind (control schemes, planners, deep learning). I'm most interested in mechanics and software co-design: how do we let these two things inform each other?

## engineering/research interests
- robust autonomy
- adapting to loss of mechanical function
- robotic manipulation and motion planning
- mechanical design
- deep learning
- applications: space systems, assistive care, emergency response

## other passions
- education accessibility
- housing and healthcare equity
- environmental justice and sustainability
- queer studies ([see my current reading list](https://bpl.bibliocommons.com/list/share/1900259209_alinasarmiento/1900265989_queer_literature))

I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts but I come from Newark, California in the SF Bay Area. I'm okay with any pronouns, but tend to go by they/them. I am a serial sock mismatcher.

[^1] in MIT-speak, i'm Course 2-A/LMPS (similar to 2-A/6), 18 minor, concentration in WGS. phew!
